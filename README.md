# Modern React with Redux

I was developing web applications with Angular for the last couple years and with this repo I decided to refresh my knowledge with React and Redux.

## JSX Project

Simple React project that covers components communication with props.

## Seasons Project

Simple React project that covers components lifecycle methods. Seasons App is using browser geolocation to define the season (summer/winter) and implement some stylings to the page according to the selected season.

### Step to run the any project

1. `cd jsx`
2. `npm install`
3. `yarn start`
4. `open browser with  http://localhost:3000/`
